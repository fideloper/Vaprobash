For [Vaprobash](https://github.com/fideloper/Vaprobash), please make pull requests to the **Develop** branch. Github will, by default, attempt to merge with the **Master** branch. However, Pull Requests should be made to the **Develop** branch so they can be test and/or refined before finally being merged into **Master**.

For [this website](https://github.com/fideloper/Vaprobash/tree/gh-pages), you can make any improvements to the **gh-pages** branch. Please make any larger modifications (new pages, different designs) to a branch of **gh-pages** (perhaps **gh-pages-dev**) so they can be tested/updated before being merged into **gh-pages**.
    
When you contribute, there are a few places that could use editing:

- For now, the `readme.md` file should be updated with any information (if appropriate) reflecting your contribution
- In addition to a bash script, the `Vagrant` file should also be properly commented and otherwise edited.
- Please make a separate pull request updating the `gh-pages` branch (this site) if appropriate.
